\title{Backward elimination for a given polynomial}
\description{Performs a backward elimination for a given polynomial, whose terms are 
read from a parameter matrix. The terms are removed in such a way that the one step 
forecast error is increased minimally. }
\usage{polyback(series, l = -1, x = 0, c = 1, m = 2, d = 1, n = -1, s = 1, scale = 1, p = -1)}
\arguments{
  \item{series}{a vector or a matrix.}
  \item{l}{number of data to use.}
  \item{x}{number of lines to be ignored.}
  \item{c}{column to be read.  }
  \item{m}{embedding dimension.  }
  \item{d}{delay. }
  \item{n}{length for the insample error estimation.}
  \item{s}{steps to be forecasted. }
  \item{scale}{final number of terms.}
  \item{p}{name of the input matrix created with \code{polypar} or by hand.}
}
\value{
A dataframe containing the  number of remaining terms in the polynomial
in column 1, the in-sample error produced by the reduced polynomial in 
column 2, the out-of-sample error produced by the reduced polynomial in
column 3 and the term removed last from the polynomial in column 4.
