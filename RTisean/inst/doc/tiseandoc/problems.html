<h1>Problems?</h1>
There are different kinds of problems you can encounter with these packages.
Here are some suggestions on how to solve them. Please send e-mail to us only
after you have gone through this list and all else failed.
<p>
Before you worry too much, maybe you should check if a newer release of <a
href="http://www.mpipks-dresden.mpg.de/~tisean">TISEAN</a> is available.  You
may also have a look at the <a href="changes.html">changes</a> we made since
the last version.
<p>
<h4>Conceptual problems</h4>
<font color=red><b>Q:</b></font> 
What is the meaning of the algorithms? What can they do for me, my
time series  application?
<p>
<font color=red><b>A:</b></font>
Read the <a href="chaospaper/TiseanHTML.html">Introduction to the methods</a>. Also
read the book:
<blockquote>H. Kantz and T. Schreiber
  <br><a href=
"http://www.mpipks-dresden.mpg.de/~schreibe/myrefs/book.html">
<em>Nonlinear Time Series Analysis</em></a>
<br> Cambridge University Press (1997)</blockquote>
and the specific references given in the documentation.

<h4>Usage problems</h4>
<font color=red><b>Q:</b></font> What do the options mean? How should I set them?
<p>
<font color=red><b>A:</b></font>
Read the documentation for your program and the references given. 
Re-read the book. If you 
know what you want to do with the programs, you will probably know how to set
the parameters. 

<h4>Implementational problems</h4>
<font color=red><b>Q:</b></font> What is the program doing in detail? How is it
doing things? 
<p>
<font color=red><b>A:</b></font>
Read the <a href="chaospaper/TiseanHTML.html">Introduction to the methods</a>.
Have a look at the source code (don't expect comments or other gimmicks). 
<h4>Strange results</h4>
<font color=red><b>Q:</b></font> What do the results mean?
<p>
<font color=red><b>A:</b></font> Try some simple examples first, using
generated data. Check if you installed everything correctly. If the programs
work on standard data, but you can't figure out what they do on your
experimental time series, it is likely that there is a scope mismatch between
the methods and your data. Occasionally, it might be just a formatting or
preprocessing problem which should be easy to fix for you. If you have strong
reasons to believe that the programs are not doing what they should, contact <a
href="mailto:tisean@mpipks-dresden.mpg.de">tisean@mpipks-dresden.mpg.de</a>.

<h4>Program crashes</h4>
<font color=red><b>Q:</b></font> What is wrong?
<p>
<font color=red><b>A:</b></font>
 Make sure the options are o.k. and the files exist/have the correct
permissions. Not much checking is done by the programs. If you believe that
you have detected a malfunction, contact 
<a href="mailto:tisean@mpipks-dresden.mpg.de">tisean@mpipks-dresden.mpg.de</a>.
