<h3>List of changes</h3>
</center>


<a name="tisean2.0"></a>
<h4>TISEAN_2.0 -&gt; TISEAN_2.1</h4>
<ul>
<li>The input routines for time series had to be changed. A safety feature made
   them too slow on many platforms. In the new version, the user has to ensure
   that the file has enough columns for the task planned since otherwise,
   missing data is read from the following line(s).
<li>An internal change worth mentioning is the calling sequence for
   <font color=blue><tt>neigh</tt></font>. The array containing the time series
   has to be given twice. The reason is that this allows two different arrays
   to be specified. Distances across series are necessary for <a
   href="xc2.html">xc2</a>.
<li><a name="c1"> The program <a
   href="../docs_f/c1.html"</a>c1</a> now accepts mutivariate time series
   and can perform mixed embeddings. Also, embedding dimension 1 is now
   allowed. As a further important change, the center points are now selected
   randomly ratehr than taken to be the first points in the set. The comparison
   is however still performed with points starting from the beginning of the
   series. 
<li><a name="project"><a name="predict"><a name="lazy"><a name="xc2">
   In <a href="../docs_f/project.html"</a>project</a>,
      <a href="../docs_f/preict.html"</a>predict</a><a
      href="../docs_f/lazy.html"</a>lazy</a>, 
      and <a href="../docs_f/xc2.html"</a>xc2</a>,
   the restriction that the embedding dimension must be at least 2 has been
   removed. 
<li><a name="wiener">
   The Wiener filter <a href="../docs_f/wiener.html"</a>wiener1/2</a> has
   been improved by offering a smoothed spectral estimator rather than raw
   periodograms. 
</ul>



<a name="tisean1.2"></a>
<h4>TISEAN_1.2 -&gt; TISEAN_2.0</h4>
<ul>
<li><a name="events"><a name="intervals">
   Utilities for the conversion of inter-event intervals to event times and
   vice versa have been added. They are called <a href="events.html">events</a>
   and <a href="intervals.html">intervals</a>. 
<li><a name="noise"></a>
   <font color=blue>noise</font> is no longer supported. If you are
   desperate, you can find it still in the <font
   color=blue><tt>unsupported</tt></font> directory.
<li><a name="autocor3"></a>
   <font color=blue>autocor3</font> is no longer supported. If you are
   desperate, you can find it still in the <font
   color=blue><tt>unsupported</tt></font> directory. I never used it myself and
   it was in C. It had to go.
<li><a name="lyapunov"></a>
   <font color=blue>lyapunov</font> is no longer supported due to its
   redundancy with <a href="../docs_c/lyap_k.html">lyap_k</a>. If you are
   desperate, you can find it still in the <font
   color=blue><tt>unsupported</tt></font> directory.
<li><a name="surrogates"></a>
   <a href="surrogates.html"</a>surrogates</a> has been rewritten in FORTRAN
   with a slight change in its functionality.
<li><a name="timrev"></a>
   <a href="timerev.html"</a>timerev</a> has been rewritten in FORTRAN,
   same functionality.
<li><a name="addnoise"></a>
   <a href="addnoise.html"</a>addnoise</a>
   can now run without input files, just as a random number generator.
<li><a name="randomize"></a>
   There are three new members in the <a href="randomize.html"</a>randomize</a>
   family, one for unevenly sampled data and two  suitable for inter-spike 
   interval series.
<li>An interference between option names has been removed. In the <a
   href="randomize.html">randomize</a> family, <font
   color=blue><tt>-w</tt></font> has been changed to <font
   color=blue><tt>-u</tt></font>.  
<li><a name="c1"><a name="c2naive">
    <a name="c2d"><a name="c2g"><a name="c2t">
    The output of the correlation sum programs has been partially
   restructured. Seperate files for different embedding dimensions are no
   longer written, everything come in  a single file, seperated by double blank
   lines. Thus, <a href="c1.html"</a>c1</a>, <a href="c2.html"</a>c2</a>, and
   <a href="c2naive.html"</a>c2naive</a> are now compatible with
   <a href="../docs_c/d2.html"</a>d2</a>. These changes also affect 
   <a href="c2d.html"</a>c2d</a>,
   <a href="c2g.html"</a>c2g</a>, and <a href="c2t.html"</a>c2t</a>,
   which thereby also become usable for <a href="../docs_c/d2.html"</a>d2</a>.
   Writing to stdout is now the default and stdin is acceptable as input file.
<li><a name="stp">The output of <a href="stp.html"</a>stp</a> can now be better
   controlled, specifying the spacing of level lines and the number of time
   steps. 
<li><a name="xc2"><a name="compare">
   The output of the correlation sum programs has been partially
   restructured. This applies to <a href="../docs_c/xc2.html"</a>xc2</a> as
   well. Also, rather than reading from two files, now two columns from the
   same file are read. The latter also applies to 
   <a href="compare.html"</a>compare</a>.
<li>The program <font color=blue><tt>randomize_generic_exp_random</tt></font> 
   was quite useless and has therefore been removed.
<li><a name="c1">As a personal service to Remo Badii, a "feature" of <a
   href="../docs_f/c1.html"</a>c1</a> was removed that caused small values
   of k to be computed more than once, a result of having k discrete but in a 
   logarithmic loop.
<li><a name="randomize">The module structure is changed slightly to enable the
   future incorporation of multivariate data. Please check the new <a
   href="randomize_extend.html">extension guide</a>. 
<li>A new program is available to <a href="cluster.html">cluster</a> a 
   dissimilarity matrix.
</ul>




<a name="tisean1.0"></a>
<h4>TISEAN_1.0 -&gt; TISEAN_1.2</h4>
<ul>
<li><a name="c2t"></a><a name="c2g"></a>
   An oddity with the command line parsing of 
   <a href="c2t.html">c2t</a> and
   <a href="c2g.html">c2g</a> has been fixed.
<li><a name="ar-run"></a>
   A back end to <a href="../docs_c/ar-model.html">ar-model</a> 
   has been added that runs an
   autoregressive model. It is called <a href="ar-run.html">ar-run</a>. 

</ul>


<a name="tisean0.9"></a>
<h4>TISEAN_0.9 -&gt; TISEAN_1.0</h4>
<ul>
<li>A few of the FORTRAN programs confused one compiler due to the order
    of declarations, which has now been changed to be conservative.
<li>Depending on the number of data points, the necessary zero padding in
    <a href="wiener.html">wiener1</a>
    was awkward, if not outright wrong. This has been fixed now.
</ul>



<a name="tisean0.5"></a>
<h4>TISEAN_0.5 -&gt; TISEAN_0.9</h4>
<ul>
<li>Changed the output file behaviour in accordance with what the Dresden
    programs do: By default, most programs write to stdout now, independent of
    the input source. The option <font color=blue><tt>-o</tt></font> tells the
    program to build file names from the input file name, or "stdin" if
    appropriate. Finally, <font color=blue><tt>-o </tt> <em>outfile</em></font>
    specifies an <a href=../general.html#outfile>output file name</a> explicitly. Somewhat awkwardly, this will be
    the same for all input files processed and results are <font
    color=red>overwritten</font> if you don't move the files fast enough. 
    This behaviour may be changed in later releases once I have a good idea
    what else to do.
<li>Quite a number of options have changed in the course of the re-unification
    process. Most propminently, 
    <font color=blue><tt>-r</tt></font>/<font color=blue><tt>-R</tt></font> 
    replaces
    <font color=blue><tt>-e</tt></font>/<font color=blue><tt>-E</tt></font> 
    for absolute lengths scales.
<li>Gradually, more and more programs respond meaningfully to the <font
    color=blue><tt>-V</tt></font> (verbosity) option. 
</ul>

<a name="tisean0.4"></a>
<h4>TISEAN_0.4 -&gt; TISEAN_0.5</h4>
<ul>
<li>Recovered correct version of 
    <a href="c2.html">c2</a> which was
    (slightly) broken in release 0.4.
<li>The realisation of <a href="randomize.html">randomize</a> that 
    implements the
    autocorrelation function suffered from a last-minute change that didn't
    quite work out and was unusable. Now fixed.
<li>All programs interpret anything which is not a valid option or its value as
    a file name. This allows to give file names at arbitrary places on the
    command line, a tiny step towards re-unification of the Dresden and
    Wuppertal branches.
<li>All programs, when called without a file name, act as if a "-" was given,
    and read from stdin if that is appropriate. As a side effect, a few
    programs have to be called with <font color=blue><tt>-h</tt></font> in
    order to see the command line options, since a call with no arguments would
    be a valid execution.
</ul>


<a name="tisean0.3"></a>
<h4>TISEAN_0.3 -&gt; TISEAN_0.4</h4>
<ul>
<li>Almost all (FORTRAN) programs now accept an option 
    <font color=blue><tt> -V# </tt></font> that specifies the level of
    diagnostic output. The default is as a rule what was there in
    TISEAN_0.3. Specifying <font color=blue><tt> -V0 </tt></font> now switches 
    off all but fatal error messages. No more reporting of file opening etc.
<li>Introduced utilities for usage message, removing repetitions of the same
    code sequences through all sources. 
<li>Unstable periodic orbits and their
    stabilities (<a href="upo.html">upo</a>). Stabilities are still somewhat
    experimental.  
<li>Embedding of periodic orbits (<a href="upoembed.html">upoembed</a>). 
<li>General constrained
    randomization (<a href="randomize.html">randomize</a>). Contains modules
    for constraints involving linear correlations, others are planned. Own
    programming efforts to specify exotic constraints are encouraged.
</ul>

<a name="tisean0.2"></a>
<h4>TISEAN_0.2 -&gt; TISEAN_0.3</h4>
<ul>
<li><a href="timerev.html">timerev</a> and
    <a href="autocor3.html">autocor3</a>:
    bug that prevented from reading input removed.
<li>Made parsing of commandline arguments more stable (hopefully): larger
    numbers (up to 20 digits) are handled.
</ul>



<a name="tisean0.1"></a>
<h4>TISEAN_0.1 -&gt; TISEAN_0.2</h4>

<ul>
<li><a href="pc.html">pc</a> prints out the
    fractions of the variance covered by the principal directions. 
<li>Recovered correct versions of 
    <a href="lazy.html">lazy</a>  and 
    <a href="project.html">project</a>:
    the difference in the second columns are now formed corerctly,
    with respect to the raw data, not to the last iterate.
</ul>
