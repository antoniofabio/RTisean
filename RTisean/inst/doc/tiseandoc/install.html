<h1>Installation</h1> 
<font color=red><b>Note:</b></font> As you may know, we are not a software
company and, after all, you got this package for free, so don't expect anything
to be fool-proof, or even comfortable. We have compiled this package only under
linux on PCs, digital unix on alpha workstations, under solaris and SunOS on a
sun, under IRIX on a silicon graphics indigo worstation, and under HP-UX on a
Hewlett-Packard computer. We use it routinely on linux PCs and on DEC alpha.
<p>
All you probably have to do is to say
<blockquote>
    <tt>&gt; <font color=blue>./configure</font></tt>
<br><tt>&gt; <font color=blue>make</font></tt>
<br><tt>&gt; <font color=blue>make install</font></tt>
</blockquote>
<p>
By default, the executables go to <font color=blue><tt>$HOME/bin</tt></font>,
you can change that to <font color=blue><tt>mydir</tt></font> by
<blockquote>
   <tt>&gt; <font color=blue>./configure --prefix=mydir</font></tt>
</blockquote>
In the tcsh, you may need to do as well:
<blockquote>
   <tt>&gt; <font color=blue>rehash</font></tt>
</blockquote>

<p>
If you have a recent version of <font color=blue><tt>gnuplot</tt></font>
installed at your site and you are impatient, you can now change to the <font
color=blue><tt>examples</tt></font> directory and try to run gnuplot on
any of the <font color=blue><tt>.gnu</tt></font> files.  These should produce
plots similar to those shown as examples in the documentation pages.

<p>
<h2>Possible installation problems</h2> 

<font color=red><b>make:</b></font> 
There are many versions of <font color=blue><tt>make</tt></font>. 
I have verified the Makefile with GNU make (Linux: PC, solaris: sun sparc), 
DEC make (Digital Unix: alpha), 
SGI make (IRIX System V.4: silicon graphics SGI), and HP-UX make.
Who knows what else can go wrong. 

<p>
<font color=red><b>f77/g77, gcc/cc/acc:</b></font> You can
override what <font color=blue><tt>configure</tt></font> finds by setting the
environment variables <font color=blue><tt>FC</tt></font> and <font
color=blue><tt>CC</tt></font>,
respectively. Use double quotes for a multi-word command.  We have tested the
Fortran routines on g77 (Linux: PC, solaris: sun sparc), DEC f77 (Digital Unix:
alpha), MIPS f77 3.10 (IRIX System V.4: silicon graphics SGI), HP-UX f77 and
on Absoft FORTRAN 77 compiler version 4.4 (tested on Linux, also available for
Mac and Windows. Note that for this compiler you have to set the stack size
very large or unlimited, which usually only root can do.). 
The C routines were tested with gcc (Linux: PC, solaris and SunOS 4.1.4: sparc,
Digital Unix: alpha), DEC cc (Digital Unix: alpha), cc (IRIX System V.4:
silicon graphics SGI), solaris cc, HP-UX cc. In any case, the C compiler must
be able to handle <font color=red>ANSI C</font> function headers.

<p>
<font color=red><b>size:</b></font> The Fortran programs allocate memory which
might exceed what you can make available. In such a case you need to edit the
programs and change these sizes, sometimes also in major sub-programs, sorry).
Also, if you request things for which the allocated space is too small, the
programs will stop with a brief message asking you to make certain parameters
larger. Before you do so, think twice if you aren't misusing the programs - the
sizes are chosen generously for normal purposes.  With some compilers,
e.g. Absoft, automatic allocation makes use of the stack and the stach size
limit may be easily exceeded on your system. It is then necessary to unlimit or
at least increase the stack size. The alternative, to enforce static allocation
by a compiler option didn't work with Absoft since the executables became
ridiculously huge.

<p>
<font color=red><b><p>machine constants:</b></font> Some of the Fortran
programs use machine constants. In an emergency, these may be changed in
<font color=blue><tt>i1mach.f</tt></font>,
<font color=blue><tt>r1mach.f</tt></font>, and
<font color=blue><tt>d1mach.f</tt></font> in
<font color=blue><tt>source_f/slatec</tt></font>
