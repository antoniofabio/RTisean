<h1 align=center>Description of the program: <font color=Blue>false_nearest
</font>
</h1>
<hr>
This program looks for the nearest neighbors of all data points in m
dimensions and iterates these neighbors one step into the future. If
the ratio of the distance of the iteration and that of the
nearest neighbor exceeds a given threshold the point is marked as a
wrong neighbor. The output is the fraction of <a href="../chaospaper/node9.html">false neighbors</a> for the
specified embedding dimensions (see <a href="../chaospaper/citation.html#kennel92">
Kennel et al.</a>).
<p>
<b><font color=red>Note:</font></b>
We implemented a new second criterion.
If the distance to the nearest neighbor becomes smaller than the
standard deviation of the data devided by the threshold, the point is
omitted. This turns out to be a stricter criterion, but can show the
effect that for increasing embedding dimensions the number of points
which enter the statistics is so small, that the whole statistics is
meanlingless. <b>Be aware of this!</b>

<font color=Red>false_nearest [Options]</font>
<p>
Everything not being a valid option will be interpreted as a potential datafile name. Given no datafile at all, means read stdin. Also <font color=Red>-</font> means stdin

Possible options are:

<h2 align=center>Description of the Output:</h2>
<b>output on stdout (or in the file):</b><br>
first column: the embedding dimension<br>
second column: the fraction of false nearest neighbors<br>
third column: the average size of the neighborhood<br>
fourth column: the average of the squared size of the neighborhood<br>
