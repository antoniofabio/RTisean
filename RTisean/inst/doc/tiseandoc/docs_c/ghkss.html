<h1 align=center>Description of the program: <font color=Blue>ghkss
</font>
</h1>
<hr>

This program performs a <a href="../chaospaper/node24.html">noise
reduction</a> as proposed in <a
href="../chaospaper/citation.html#on">Grassberger et al</a>. In
principal, it performs a orthogonal projection onto a q-dimensional
manifold using a special (tricky) metric. In case the <font
color=red>-2</font> parameter is set, an euclidean metric is
used. This is done in <a
href="../chaospaper/citation.html#cawley">Cawley et al.</a> as well as
in <a href="../chaospaper/citation.html#sauer">Sauer</a> and is
sometimes useful for flow systems.

<font color=Red>ghkss [Options]</font>
<p>
Everything not being a valid option will be interpreted as a potential
datafile name. Given no datafile at all, means read stdin. Also <font
color=Red>-</font> means stdin

Possible options are:

<h2 align=center>Description of the Output:</h2>
Each file produced contains the filtered time series as one
column. The standard error device shows some statistics, namely for each 
iteration (i)
the number of vectors corrected up to the actual value of the
neighborhood size, (ii) the average shift and (iii) the average correction.
(iv) The next line shows for how many points the correction was
unreasonably large and the last line shows (v) the file, to which the
corrected data was written.
