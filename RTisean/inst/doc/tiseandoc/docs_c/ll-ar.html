<h1 align=center>Description of the program: <font color=Blue>ll-ar
</font>
</h1>
<hr>
This program makes a local linear ansatz and estimates the one step
prediction error of the model. The difference to <a href="onestep.html">
onestep</a> is that it does it as a <a href="../chaospaper/node20.html#casdagli">function of the neighborhood size</a> 
(see <a href="../chaospaper/citation.html#casdagli91"> Casdagli</a>).

<p>
<b>ll-ar</b> means something like <b>local-linear -&#155; AR-model</b>

<h2 align=center>Usage:</h2>
<center>
<font color=Red>ll-ar [Options]</font>
<p>
Everything not being a valid option will be interpreted as a potential datafile name. Given no datafile at all, means read stdin. Also <font color=Red>-</font> means stdin
<p>
Possible options are:

<h2 align=center>Description of the Output:</h2>
The output consists of 5 columns for each neighborhood size:</b>
<ul>
<li> neighborhood size (units of the data)
<li> relative forecast error ((forecast error)/(variance of the data))
<li> fraction of points for which neighbors were found for this neighborhood 
size
<li> average number of neighbors found per point
<li> variance of the fraction of points for which neighbors were found
</ul>
