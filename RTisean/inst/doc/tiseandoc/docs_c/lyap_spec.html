<h1 align=center>Description of the program: <font color=Blue>lyap_spec
</font>
</h1>
<hr>
This program estimates the whole spectrum of Lyapunov exponents for a
given, possibly multivariate, time series. Whole spectrum means: If d
components are given and the embedding
dimension is m than m*d exponents will be determined. The method is
based on the work of <a href="../chaospaper/citation.html#sasa">Sano and Sawada</a>.

<h2 align=center>Usage:</h2>
<center>
<font color=Red>lyap_spec [Options]</font>
<p>
Everything not being a valid option will be interpreted as a potential datafile name. Given no datafile at all, means read stdin. Also <font color=Red>-</font> means stdin
<p>
Possible options are:

<h2 align=center>Description of the Output:</h2>
The output consists of <font color=blue>d*m+1</font> columns. The first
one shows the actual iteration, the next <font color=blue>d*m</font>
ones the estimates of the Lyapunov exponents in decreasing order. The
last lines show the average forecast error(s) of the local linear
model, the average neighborhood size used for fitting the model and
the last one the estimated Kaplan-Yorke dimension.<br>
Output is written every 10 seconds (real time), approximately.
