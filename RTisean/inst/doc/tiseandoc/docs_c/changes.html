<h4 align=center>Changes</h4>
<ul>
<li>I continued to modify programs in such a way that they are able to
handle multivariate data. Modified in this release: <a
href="ar-model.html">ar-model</a>, <a href="extrema.html">extrema</a>,
<a href="nstep.html">nstep</a>, <a href="boxcount.html">boxcount</a>,
<a href="lyap_spec.html">lyap_spec</a>, <a
href="recurr.html">recurr</a>, <a href="makenoise.html">makenoise</a>
and <a href="rescale.html">rescale</a>.
</li>

<li>
To achieve consistency with the other programs I renamed some
flags. The affected programs and flags are: <a href="d2.html">d2</a>
flags <font color=red>-e to -r</font>, <font color=red>-E to -R</font>
and therefore, <font color=red>-R to -E</font>, <a
href="av-d2.html">av-d2</a> flag <font color=red>-e to -E</font>,
<a href="histogram.html">histogram</a> flag <font color=red>-e to
-r</font> and <a href="boxcount.html">boxcount</a> flag <font
color=red>-e to -r</font> and <font color=red>-E to -R</font>.
</li>

<li> I gave unique <a href="../../source_c/routines/tisean_cec.h">exit
codes</a> to all the exceptions in the routines. I'm pretty sure
Thomas will have doubts about the usefulness of this, but who knows
what it is good for.
</li>

<li>Again <a href="recurr.html">recurr</a>: It does no longer print
the diagonal terms. That was really nothing than a waste of disc
space. Furthermore, it now uses a two-dimensional box assisted search
algorithm. Should be a bit faster, therefore.
</li>

<li><a href="makenoise.html">makenoise</a> has got a new flag <font
color=red>-0</font> which, if set, allows to produce random numbers
without reading any data.
</li>

<li><a href="zeroth.html">zeroth</a> was replaced by the old <a
href="zeroth.html">mzeroth</a>. It got one new
functionality. Depending on the Verbosity level it now prints the
individual forecast error for each component of each reference point.
</li>

<li><a href="nstep.html">nstep</a> got a new flag <font
color=red>-0</font>. Setting this flag causes nstep to perform a
zeroth order fit instead of a local linear one.
</li>

<li><a href="nstat_z.html">nstat_z</a> the flag <font
color=red>-S</font> was renamed <font color=red>-s</font> to be
consistent with the other programs.
</li>

<li>The programs <a href="nstat_z.html">nstat_z</a>, <a
href="zeroth.html">zeroth</a>, <a href="onestep.html">onestep</a>
and <a href="ll-ar.html">ll-ar</a> got a new flag <a
href="causality.html">-C</a>.
</li>

<li>The program <a href="nrlazy.html">nrlazy</a> got a new verbosity
level. If this level is set the number of neighbors used for the
correction is printed to the output file. If this number is 1, no
correction was done.
</li>

</ul>
<hr>
<h4 align=center>Bug Fixes</h4>
<ul>
<li>There was a slight inconsistency in the <a
href="xcor.html">xcor</a> man page. The page stated the output file
contains &#60;x<sub>t</sub>*y<sub>t-d</sub>&#62;, instead it is
&#60;x<sub>t</sub>*y<sub>t+d</sub>&#62;. REMOVED (Thanks to Mario
again)</li>

<li><a href="d2.html">d2</a> crashed when the maximal dimension was
ONE. FIXED. (Results for 'non crashing' cases were not influenced, at
all)</li>

<li>There was a bug in <a href="mutual.html">mutual</a>, which could
lead to negative mutual information in case that the delay time was
long compared with the length of the time series. FIXED (Thanks to
Eckehard) 
</li>

<li>Though stated somewhere on this page, the output of <a
href="histogram.html">histogram</a> was not produced in such a way
that the integration over the whole data interval gave 1. Now it
does.
</li>

<li>I removed a lot of 'index out of range segmentation faults' in the
programs. (Thanks to a lot of people)
</ul>

<hr>
<h4 align=center>New programs</h4>
<ul>
<li> <a href="sav_gol.html">sav_gol</a>: Performes a Savitzky-Golay
filter on, possibly multivariate, data to either clean the data or to
get better estimates for their derivatives.</li>
<li><font color=red>Suggestions for further (not too specific)
programs are welcome.</font></li>

<hr>
<h4 align=center>Changes</h4>
<ul>
<li>
A new routine <a href="../../source_c/routines/exclude_interval.c">
exclude_interval</a> was added to <a
href="routines.html">tsa.h</a>. It allows to exclude an interval of
indexes from a list of neighbors found.</li>
<li><a name="lyap_k"></a>
When the parameter of <font color=red>-m</font> is larger than
that of <font color=red>-M</font> in <a href="lyap_k.html">lyap_k</a>,
now the <font color=red>-m</font> value is used. (Thanks to Jens
Timmer)</li>
<li>Furthermore, <a href="lyap_k.html">lyap_k</a> was rewritten in C.</li>
<li>The programs <font color=blue>delay, make_ps</font> were
removed from the supported part of the package. In case you are
a fan of these programs, you'll find the sources and the html-files in
the directory <font color=blue>unsupported</font>. As the
name says, there will be no support, what so ever, for these
programs. Maybe <font color=blue>make_ps</font> will come back in a
later version when it is useful for more people, not only for me.
</li>
<li>The program <a href="histogram.html">histogram</a> was rewritten
in C. This means the package is now C++ free.</li>
<li>The program <a href="nrlazy.html">nrlazy</a> has an additional
option <font color=red>-v</font> which allows to set the neighborhood
size in units of the standard deviation of the data.</li>
<li>The program <a href="d2.html">d2</a> is now able to handle multivariate
data, also with mixed embeddings. Further, the default for the <font
color=red>-N</font> is now 1000 instead of all. To get all back, set the
value to 0. Furthermore, columns 1 and 3 in the output files are
interchanged. The first column now contains the length scales in units
of the data.</li>
<li>The program <a href="av-d2.html">av-d2</a> was changed in a way
that it is now able to handle the output of the files of the program. 
Since the natural units
for length scales are the default units now, the option <font
color=red>-r</font> was replaced by <font color=red>-e</font>.</li>
<li>Some of the messages of the programs were changed to avoid that
they look like error messages. (Thanks to Christian
R&ouml;denbeck)</li>
<li>Two new routines to handle multivariate time series were added to
<a href="routines.html">tsa.h</a>: <a
href="../../source_c/routines/make_multi_box.c">make_multi_box</a> and
<a href="../../source_c/routines/find_multi_neighbors.c">
find_multi_neighbors</a>.</li>
<li>To reduce the number of <i>segmentation faults</i> another
routine <a
href="../../source_c/routines/check_alloc.c">check_alloc</a> was added
to <a href="routines.html">tsa.h</a>.</li>
<li>A new flag <font color=red>-S</font> was added for the <a
href="zeroth.html">zeroth</a> program.</li>
<li>The <font color=red>-F</font> was replaced by <font
color=red>-c</font></li>.
<li>To make the <font color=red>-c</font> and <font
color=red>-m</font> flags more flexible to use I changed the routine
<a
href="../../source_c/routines/get_multi_series.c">get_multi_series</a>
in <a href="routines.html">tsa.h</a>.</li>
<li>Now <a href="mutual.html">mutual</a> uses the standard norm for
its output.</li>
<li>A new routine <a
href="../../source_c/routines/what_i_do.c">what_i_do</a> was added to
<a href="routines.html">tsa.h</a>. It
displays kind of a welcome message when the program is started.</li>
<li>A new routine <a
href="../../source_c/routines/myfgets.c">myfgets</a> was added to <a
href="routines.html">tsa.h</a>. It handles loooong input lines.</li>
<li>A new flag <font color=red>-V</font> was added for all
programs. It allows to add an <a href=../general.html#verbosity>verbosity level</a> like in Thomas'
programs. See the corresponding help pages for more info. According to
this change, I had to modify the routine <font
color=blue>get_series</font> and <font color=blue>get_series</font> in
<a href="routines.html">tsa.h</a>.</li>
<li><a href="lyap_spec.html">lyap_spec</a> is now able to handle
delays other than 1.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h4 align=center>Bug Fixes</h4>
<ul>
<li><a name="ll-ar"></a>
When using the routines <a href="ll-ar.html">ll-ar</a>, <a
href="onestep.html">onestep</a> and <a href="zeroth.html">zeroth</a>
with the <font color=red>-s</font> flag set to a value larger than 1
the points mapped into the interval [actual point,actual point + value
of -s] were not excluded from the neighborhood. This caused causality
problems especially for oversampled flow data, which could result in
a severe underestimation of the forecast errors. FIXED (Thanks to Mario
Ragwitz and Holger)</li>
<li>The <font color=red>-r</font> flag in <a
href="xzero.html">xzero</a> was buggy. When used, the result was
usually (depending on the architecture) a <font color=blue>floating
execption</font>. (Thanks to Mario Ragwitz)</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h4 align=center>New programs</h4>
<ul>
<li><a name="mzeroth"></a>
<a href="zeroth.html">mzeroth</a>: Estimates the forecast errors for
a multicomponent time series using a zeroth order model.</li>
<li><a name="nstat_z"></a>
<a href="nstat_z.html">nstat_z</a>: Takes a scalar time series,
divides it into pieces and estimates the zeroth order cross-forecast
errors as a test for nonstationarity.</li>

<h4 align=center>Changes</h4>
<ul>
<li><a name="ar-model"></a>
   In <a href="ar-model.html">ar-model</a> now the mean is first subtracted
   which should be less confusing.</li>
<li>A new routine <a
   href="../c/routines/test_outfile.c">test_outfile</a> was added to
   <a href="routines.html">tsa.h</a> which tests whether a file for
   writing the output into can be created or not.</li>
<li>Another new routine <a
   href="../c/routines/invert_matrix.c">invert_matrix</a> was added
   to <a href="routines.html">tsa.h</a>. It inverts a square matrix
   and is based on <a href="../c/routines/solvele.c">solvele</a>.</li>
<li><a href="lyap_k.html">lyap_k</a> wanted to have the epsilon values
   in units of the data, the output was in rescaled
   units, though. Since this was a bit confusing, it was changed. Now output
   is also in units of the data.</li>
<li>All programs were modified such that they use the routine 
   <a href="../c/routines/test_outfile.c">test_outfile</a>.</li>
<li><a name="rbf"></a>
   <a href="rbf.html">rbf</a>: The distribution of the centers and
   the variance of the gaussians was changed to make the program more
   effective. Now less centers should be necessary. Furthermore, the
   program should be much faster now and thus the default is now:
   write to stdout.</li>
<li><a name="histogram"></a>
   <a href="histogram.html">histogram</a>: The output was changed in
   a way that now the integral over the second column should be 1.</li>

<h4 align=center>Bug Fixes</h4>
<ul>
<li><a name="lyap_spec"></a>
<a href="lyap_spec.html">lyap_spec</a> was expecting a value for
the flag -I though there was no need for it. FIXED (Results were not
influenced)</li>
<li><a name="extrema"></a>
<a href="extrema.html">extrema</a>: The first value was
nonsens. FIXED. (All other values were not influenced)</li>
<li><a name="false_nearest"></a>
<a href="false_nearest.html">false_nearest</a>: The condition for
the maximal allowed distance between the pairs of points was
implemented wrongly. FIXED. (It did influence your results, but buggy
though, it was still a stronger condition than the original one of
Kennel et al.)</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h4 align=center>New programs</h4>
<ul>
<li><a name="fsle"></a>
A program for estimating the finite size Lyapunov exponents <a
href="fsle.html">fsle</a> was added. (BETA. I'm not completely sure
whether this program does what it is supposed to do. So please be
careful in using it.)</li>

<hr>
<h4 align=center>Changes</h4>
<ul>
<li>Now each html file in the docs directory contains a description of
what the output of the programs is.</li>
<li>The <a href="false_nearest.html">false_nearest</a> routine didn't
implement the second condition of the <a
href="../chaospaper/citation.html#kennel92">Kennel et al</a> paper. Now it is
implemented (Thanks to Wolfgang M&uuml;ller and Angelo De Santis).</li>
<li>For each program which reads only one column you can now specify
the number of the column in the filename separated by a comma.<br>
Example: <i>hen,1</i> means use column <i>1</i> of file <i>hen</i><br>
Should work in a similar way as in the Wuppertal part.
</ul>
<hr>
<h4 align=center>Bug Fixes</h4>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="../c/routines/search_datafile.c">search_datafile</a>
routines produced a <i>Segmentation fault</i> on some systems when no
valid filename was given. FIXED<br>
Additionally, if no valid filename is given at all, now stdin is read.</li>

<a name="tisean0.5">TISEAN_0.5 -&gt; TISEAN_0.9</a>
</b></font></center>
<hr>
<h4 align=center>Changes</h4>
<ul>
<li>The datafile has no longer to be the first parameter given in the
command line. It can appear anywhere. Actually, everything not being a
valid command line option will be interpreted as a possible datafile
name. If no datafile is given at all or if <font color=Red>-</font> is
given, stdin is read. If more than one datafile is specified, the last
valid one (means the last that exists) is read.<br>
A consequence is that just calling a program without given any
parameter means now: call the program with all parameters set to their
defaults and read from stdin. That means, to activate the help option,
you have to give the <font color=red>-h</font> flag in any case.</li>
<li>New option (<font color=red>-t</font>) in the 
<a href="extrema.html">extrema</a> program.</li>
<li>The meaning of the <font color=red>-s</font> flag in the 
<a href="zeroth.html">zeroth</a> program has been changed slightly. Now
giving steps larger 1 means that the program calculates all forecast errors
from step 1 to the given step. Furthermore, the output can now be written to
a file.</li>
<li>The output of the <a href="mem_spec.html">mem_spec</a> was modified to
be compatible with the output of <a href="../docs_f/spectrum.html">
spectrum</a>.</li>
<li>I modified the handling of the command line options. Now it is possible
either set a space between the flag and the value (e.g. <font color=red>
-d 3</font>) or not (e.g. <font color=red>-d3</font>). There is one flag 
<font color=red>-o</font> which can be called with a parameter or
without. Be careful! Placing the input file name in back of this flag
will cause the program to interpret it as the parameter for the
flag.</li>
<li>I succeded in removing all <font color=red>NR</font>-stuff from
the package.</li>
<li>Some of the names of flags are changed to unify them with the ones
from the Wuppertal part.</li>
<li>New flag <font color=red>-r</font> in the program 
<a href="makenoise.html">makenoise</a>. With it you can give the absolute
noiselevel (or the absolute variance in case of gaussian noise). This means
you can now produce N pure (gaussian) random numbers centered around x by<br>
<tt><font color=red>yes x |head -N | makenoise -r something (-g) -o filename
</font></tt></li>
<li>Some changes in the parameters of <a href="svd.html">svd</a>.</li>
<li>A new flag <font color=red>-V</font> for <a href="low121.html">low121</a>
which can reduce the number of output files.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h4 align=center>Bug Fixes</h4>
<ul>
<li>Due to the changes from Release 0.3 to 0.4 I introduced a bug in the 
program <a href="rbf.html">rbf</a>. Fixed</li>
<li>I called two flags in the <a href="poincare.html">poincare</a>
the same. Embarrassing isn't it? FIXED.</li>
<li>Major bug in <a href="lyap_spec.html">lyap_spec</a>. The result always
was <tt>floating exception</tt>. Fixed (Thanks to Eckehard)</li>
<li>Minor bug in <a href="lyap_k.html">lyap_k</a>. The statistics was
written to stdout instead of stderr. Fixed (Thanks to Thomas)</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h4 align=center>New programs</h4>
<ul>
<li> The program <a href="ll-ar.html">ll-ar</a> estimates the onestep
prediction error for a local linear ansatz as a function of the neighborhood
size with which the function was fitted. Could give hints whether the system
is describable by an AR-model or not.</li>
<li>There are three new program for fitting polynomials. The main one is
<a href="polynomp.html">polynomp</a> that fits a polynomial consisting
of a free configurable number of terms. <a
href="polyback.html">polyback</a> does a backward elimination and <a
href="polypar.html">polypar</a> creates a parameter file that contains
all possible terms of a polynomial.</li>
<li>I started to add programs which handle either multivariate data or
different univariate time series. The first one is <a
href="xcor.html">xcor</a> which computes the cross
correlations of two components.</li>
<li><a href="xzero.html">xzero</a>: Make a zeroth order cross
prediction of two time series.</li>
