</h1>
<hr>
This program estimates the correlation sum, 
the <a href="../chaospaper/node30.html">correlation dimension</a>
and the <a href="../chaospaper/node34.html">correlation entropy</a> 
of a given, possibly multivariate, data set. 
It uses
the box assisted search algorithm and is quite fast as long as one is
not interested in large length scales. All length scales are computed
simultaneously and the output is written every 2&nbsp;min (real time, not
cpu time). It is possible to set a maximum number of pairs. If this
number is reached for a given length scale, the length scale will no
longer be treated for the rest of the estimate.
<p>
Please consult the <a href="../chaospaper/node29.html">introduction</a> paper
for initial material on dimension estimation. If you are serious, you will need
to study some of the literature cited there as well.
<p>
In extension to what is described there, the simultaneous use
of multivariate data and temporal embedding is possible using <font color=blue>d2</font>. Thus one has
to give two numbers in order to specify the embedding dimension. 
The first is the number of multivariate components, the
second the number of lags in the temporal embedding. 
This is realized by giving two numbers
to the option <font color=blue>-M</font>, seperated by a comma.
For a standard scalar time series, set the first number to 1. If your
multivariate data spans the whole phase space and no further temporal
embedding is desired, set the second value to 1.
In any case, the total embedding dimension in the sense of the embedding
theorems is the product of the two numbers.
<p>
In order to be able to assess the convergence with increasing embedding
dimension, results are reported for several such values.  The inner loop steps
through the number of components until the first argument of <font
color=blue>M</font> is reached. The outer loop increases the number of time
lags until the second argument of <font color=blue>M</font> is reached.

<h4>Usage of the <font color=blue>-c</font> and <font color=blue>-M</font> 
flags</b></h4>

Suppose, the option <font color=blue>-M<em> x,y</em></font> has been specified.
By default, the first <font color=blue><em> x</em></font> columns of a file 
are used. This behaviour can
be modified by means of the <font color=blue>-c</font> flag. It takes
a series of numbers separated by commas. The numbers represent the
colomns. For instance <font color=red>-M 3,1 -c 3,5,7</font> means,
use three components with no additional temporal embedding, reading
columns 3, 5 and 7.  It is not necessary to give the full number of
components to the <font color=blue>-c</font> flag. If numbers are
missing, the string is filled up starting with the smallest number,
larger than the largest given. For instance, <font color=red>-M 3,1 -c
3 </font> would result in reading columns 3, 4 and 5.

<h2 align=center>Description of the Output:</h2>
The files with the extensions c2, d2 and h2 contain for each embedding
dimension  and each length scale
two columns:<br>
<b>first column:</b> epsilon (in units chosen)<br>
<b>second column:</b> the estimated quantity (correlation sum, dimension,
entropy)<br>.
<ul>
<li><b>extension .c2</b>: This file contains the correlation 
sums for all treated length scales and embedding dimensions.
<li><b>extension .d2</b>: This file contains the local slopes of the logarithm
of the correlation sum, the correlation dimension.
<li><b>extension .h2</b>: This file contains the correlation entropies.
<li><b>extension .stat</b>: This file shows the current status of the
estimate. 
</ul>
The output is written every two minutes (real time, not cpu time). So,
you can see preliminary results even if the program is still running.
Post-processing can be done in the following ways.
Either of the output sequences can be <b>smoothed</b> by <a
href="av-d2.html">av-d2</a>.
<b>Takens' estimator</b> can be obtained from the correlation sum (extension
<b>.c2</b>) using <a href="../docs_f/c2t.html">c2t</a> and then plotted 
versus upper cut-off length.
The <b>Gaussian kernel</b> correlation integral can be 
obtained from the standard correlation sum (extension
<b>.c2</b>) 
using <a href="../docs_f/c2g.html">c2g</a>.

<h2 align=center>How to get D<sub>2</sub> from the data</h2>
The file with the extension <b>.d2</b> contains the skeleton to
estimate the correlation dimension. As written above it contains the
local slopes of the correlation sums for the different embedding
dimension. To get an idea of the correlation dimension it is always a
good idea to plot the file using a log scale for the x-axis.<br>
The figures you get could look something like one of the following
ones.
<img src="d2-hen.gif"></img>
<img src="d2-noi.gif"></img>
The first figure clearly shows a plateau. This means for a wide range
of length scales (x-axis) and for all embedding dimensions larger than
a minimal one, the curves collapse and are flat. The value of the
plateau gives an estimate for the dimension (1.2... in this case). The
second figure does not give any dimension estimate, at all. All curves
behave different and there is no common behaviour. From this figure
one can not conclude any dimension for the system.<br>

Typically one finds something in between the two extremes shown
above.
